    """
    Uses the variance inflation factors between features and a 
    specified threshold to identify and remove collinear/multicollinear features.

    Args:
        df ([pandas.DataFrame]): 
            A dataframe that includes all the features that are being considered 
            for modeling without the target.df ([type]): [description]
        vif_threshold (float, optional): 
            Defaults to 10.0 as per the seminal work of Marquardt DW 
            (1970) Generalized inverses, ridge regression, biased linear 
            estimation and nonlinear estimation. Technometrics 12(3):591â€“612. Other
            rules of thumb around VIF suggest a value of as low as 4. 

    Returns:
        [pandas.DataFrame]:
            A Pandas Dataframe that has removed all collinear/multicollinear features from 
            the feature space based upon the correlation threshold.
